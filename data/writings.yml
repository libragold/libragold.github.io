    We show that the family of graphs of spectral radius $$\le \lambda$$ has a finite forbidden subgraphs characterization if and only if $$\lambda < \lambda^*$$ and $$\lambda \not\in \{\alpha_2, \alpha_3, \ldots\}$$, where $$\alpha_m = \beta_m^{1/2} + \beta_m^{-1/2}$$ and $$\beta_m$$ is the largest root of $$x^{m+1} = 1 + x + \ldots + x^{m-1}$$. As a consequence, we establish the asymptotic formula of the maximum cardinality of equiangular lines with angle $$\arccos\alpha$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ for every $$\alpha > \frac{1}{1+2\lambda^*}$$.

  summary: >
    A finite family $$\mathcal{F}$$ of graphs is $$k$$-nice if for every graph $$G$$ with $$\chi(G) = R_k(\mathcal{F})$$ (the chromatic number equals to the Ramsey number) and for every coloring of $$E(G)$$ there exists a monochromatic copy of some $$F\in\mathcal{F}$$. It seems conceivable that for any finite family of graphs $$\mathcal{F}$$ that contains at least one forest, $$\mathcal{F}$$ is $$k$$-nice for all $$k \ge k_0(\mathcal{F})$$. We show that the conjecture holds for each of the three families consisting of two connected graphs with 3 edges each.

    A set of vertices $$S$$ resolves a graph if every vertex is uniquely determined by its vector of distances to the vertices in $$S$$. The metric dimension of a graph is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set of the graph. We prove that the metric dimension of the Cartesian product of $$n$$ copies of the complete graph on $$q$$ vertices is $$(2+o(1))n/\log_q n$$.

  summary: >
    Given a system $$\mathcal{G}=(G_1, \ldots ,G_m)$$ of graphs on the same vertex set $$V$$, a cooperative coloring for $$\mathcal{G}$$ is a choice of vertex sets $$I_1, \ldots ,I_m$$, such that $$I_j$$ is independent in $$G_j$$ and $$\bigcup_{j=1}^{m}I_j = V$$. We give bounds on the minimal $$m$$ such that every $$m$$ graphs with maximum degree $$d$$ have a cooperative coloring, in the cases that (a) the graphs are trees, (b) the graphs are all bipartite.

    A hollow matrix is a square matrix whose diagonal entries are all equal to zero. Define $$\lambda^*=\rho^{1/2}+\rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$$, where $$\rho$$ is the unique real root of $$x^3=x+1$$. We show that for every $$\lambda < \lambda^*$$, there exists $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$ such that if a symmetric hollow integer matrix has an eigenvalue less than $$-\lambda$$, then one of its principal submatrices of order at most $$n$$ does as well. However, the same conclusion does not hold for any $$\lambda \ge \lambda^*$$.
