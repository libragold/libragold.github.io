I am a postdoctoral fellow in Department of Mathematics at the Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology. Previously, I was a graduate student in the ACO (Algortihms, Combinatoris, and Optimization) program at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh under the guidance of Professor [Boris Bukh](http://www.borisbukh.org/), and I was an undergraduate student at Peking University in Beijing. My research intersets include discrete geometry and extremal graph theory.

I was born and raised in the city of Shanghai. My recreational interests include board gaming and skiing.
