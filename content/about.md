I am currently an assistant professor at Arizona State University, with a joint appointment in the [School of Mathematical Statistical Sciences](https://math.asu.edu) and the [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu). My research interests include [discrete geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_geometry), [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), and [topological combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_combinatorics).

I was born and raised in [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai), and in my free time, I enjoy board gaming and skiing.
