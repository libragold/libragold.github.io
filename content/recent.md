I co-organize the Discrete Mathematics Seminar at ASU, where we explore a variety of exciting topics in the field. If you're interested, feel free to check out [our schedule](https://math.la.asu.edu/~discrete). We'd love to have you join us!

Since October 2024, I’ve been coaching ASU’s ICPC team, Chaiwala Ballers. This past season, we placed 12th at the [North America Championship](https://nac.icpc.global/scoreboard/2025/), earning a spot at the prestigious [ICPC World Finals](https://worldfinals.icpc.global/) in Baku, Azerbaijan. At the World Finals, the team delivered an outstanding performance, solving nine problems and finishing [17th](https://worldfinals.icpc.global/scoreboard/2025/index.html) overall, which earned ASU a [Highest Honors award](https://icpc.global/worldfinals/results-2025).

I put together a little tool called [Findliner](/findliner) to help boost my productivity by adding line numbers to PDFs. It’s been really useful for me, and you might find it handy too!

I organized the [Math Kangaroo competition](https://mathkangaroo.oasis-lms.com/Listing/School-of-Mathematical-and-Statistical-Sciences-ASU-Session-One-Tempe-AZ-21188) for students in grades 1–12 in the greater Phoenix area on March 20, 2025. I’ll be organizing it again in 2026. Stay tuned!
