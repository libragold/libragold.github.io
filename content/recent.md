I co-organize the Discrete Mathematics Seminar at ASU, where we explore a variety of exciting topics in the field. If you're interested, feel free to check out [our schedule](https://math.la.asu.edu/~discrete). We'd love to have you join us!

Since October 2024, I’ve been coaching ASU’s ICPC team, Chaiwala Ballers. We placed 12th in the [North America Championship](https://nac.icpc.global/home-2025/), and advanced to the [World Finals](https://worldfinals.icpc.global/), which will take place in Baku, Azerbaijan on August 31-September 5, 2025.

I put together a little tool called [Findliner](/findliner) to help boost my productivity by adding line numbers to PDFs. It’s been really useful for me, and you might find it handy too!

I organized the [Math Kangaroo competition](https://mathkangaroo.oasis-lms.com/Listing/School-of-Mathematical-and-Statistical-Sciences-ASU-Session-One-Tempe-AZ-21188) for students in grades 1–12 in the greater Phoenix area on March 20, 2025. I’ll be organizing it again in 2026. Stay tuned!
