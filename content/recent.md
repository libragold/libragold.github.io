I co-organize the Discrete Mathematics Seminar at ASU, where we explore a variety of exciting topics in the field. If you're interested, feel free to check out [our schedule](https://math.la.asu.edu/~discrete/). We'd love to have you join us!

I put together a little tool called [Findliner](/findliner) to help boost my productivity by adding line numbers to PDFs. Itâ€™s been really useful for me, and you might find it handy too!

In 2025, I'll be organizing the [Math Kangaroo competition](https://mathkangaroo.oasis-lms.com/Listing/School-of-Mathematical-and-Statistical-Sciences-ASU-Session-One-Tempe-AZ-21188) for students in grades 1-12 in the greater Phoenix area. If you know any students who might be interested, feel free to share and follow the link to register!
