<!-- ## Experience

**Instructor for Chinese Mathematical Society**
, Jun 2017 ![Chinese Mathematical Society]({{ "img/cms.png" | relURL }})  
I was invited to give lecture series at the High School Affiliated to Fudan University in 2017. The audience included the six members of the China team for the [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad) (IMO). My topics included discrete geometry and topological combinatorics.  
Team China led by [Yijun Yao](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/yjyao/) took the 2nd place at IMO 2017.

**Instructor for Mathematical Association of America**, Jun 2014, Jun 2015, and Jun 2016 ![Mathematical Association of America]({{ "img/maa.png" | relURL }})  
I was one of the coaching staff of the [Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Summer_Program) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 2014 and Carnegie Mellon University in 2015 and 2016. The participants included the six members of the USA team for the IMO. My topics included the area method, probabilistic geometry, geometric inequality, discrete geometry, and projective geometry.  
Team USA led by [Po-Shen Loh](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/) took the 2nd place at IMO 2014. The team claimed the championship title in 2015, the first time since 1994, and defended its title in 2016.
