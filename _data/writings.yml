- title: "On the metric dimension of Cartesian products of a graph"
  featured: true
  summary: >
    A set of vertices $$S$$ resolves a graph if every vertex is uniquely determined by its vector of distances to the vertices in $$S$$. The metric dimension of a graph is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set of the graph. We prove that the metric dimension of the Cartesian product of $$n$$ copies of the complete graph on $$q$$ vertices is $$(2+o(1))n/\log_q n$$.

  summary: >
    If the average degree of $$G$$ after deleting any ball of radius $$r$$ is at least $$d$$, then its second largest eigenvalue is at least $$2\sqrt{d-1}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{r+1}\right)$$.

- title: "Ramsey-nice families of graphs"
  summary: >
    A finite family $$\mathcal{F}$$ of graphs is $$k$$-nice if for every graph $$G$$ with $$\chi(G) = R_k(\mathcal{F})$$ (the chromatic number equals to the Ramsey number) and for every coloring of $$E(G)$$ there exists a monochromatic copy of some $$F\in\mathcal{F}$$. It seems conceivable that for any finite family of graphs $$\mathcal{F}$$ that contains at least one forest, $$\mathcal{F}$$ is $$k$$-nice for all $$k \ge k_0(\mathcal{F})$$. We show that the conjecture holds for each of the three families consisting of two connected graphs with 3 edges each.

- title: "Forbidden subgraphs for graphs of bounded spectral radius, with applications to equiangular lines"
  summary: >
    We find the threshold $$\lambda^* = \sqrt{2+\sqrt{5}}$$ such that, for every $$\lambda < \lambda^*$$, the family of graphs of spectral radius $$\le \lambda$$ has a finite forbidden subgraphs characterization. As a consequence, we establish the asymptotic formula of the maximum cardinality of equiangular lines with angle $$\arccos\alpha$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ for every $$\alpha > \frac{1}{1+2\lambda^*}$$.

  summary: >
    Given two disjoint convex polyhedra, we propose a process, based on projections onto the half-spaces defining the two polyhedra, for finding a pair of points, one in each polyhedron, attaining the minimum distance.

- title: "Proof of László Fejes Tóth's zone conjecture"
  summary: >
    A zone of width $$\omega$$ on the unit sphere is the set of points within spherical distance $$\omega/2$$ of a given great circle. We show that the total width of any collection of zones covering the unit sphere is at least $$\pi$$.

- title: "Bipartite algebraic graphs without quadrilaterals"
  summary: >
    We conjecture that every algebraic hypersurface that gives rise to a $$K_{s,t}$$-free graph is equivalent, in a suitable sense, to a low-degree hypersurface. We establish a version of this conjecture for $$K_{2,2}$$-free graphs.

- title: "A bound on the number of edges in graphs without an even cycle"
  summary: >
    For each fixed $$k$$, an $$n$$-vertex graph not containing a cycle of length $$2k$$ has at most $$80\sqrt{k}\log k \cdot n^{1+1/k}+O(n)$$ edges.

  summary: >
    Let $$P_0, \dots, P_d$$ be $$d + 1$$ disjoint $$n$$-point sets in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$. A colorful simplex is the convex hull of $$d + 1$$ points each of which comes from a distinct $$P_i$$. There always exists a point that is contained in at least $$\frac{2d}{(d+1)(d+1)!}n^d$$ colorful simplices.
